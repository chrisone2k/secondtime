Let's have coffee! I am sure this a great idea to enjoy the bitter and sweet taste of a hot drink while walking on the long and quiet street. Not only to give you a warm feeling but also it makes you feel relax as you enjoy the scenery of green leaves and high trees. This place for me is truly magical, especially when some leaves fell from the twig due to the breeze of wind. To fully appreciate the place where you are visiting, I recommend to have a walk, have something to eat as you pause for a moment. Sip as slow as you can and be sure to have some time to enjoy the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Looking back on this photo, apparently, you can see happiness inside me. My spirit seems quiet even though I am standing on foreign land. Perhaps if the tree behind me could speak, it could tell a lot of stories of people from different walks of life that once passed by in this area.  While time continues on its course, it is better to enjoy and seize the moment.
