description: Looking at the road seems to invite me to ride on and start a new journey.  I want to discover something great and delight my heart.

Let me share my thoughts about the roads because a road trip is one of my pleasurable activities in life. Travelling fascinates me a lot and I believe people from different walks of life love it too. 
Thinking about the road, the person that came to my mind is the famous author, Robert Frost, mainly because of his timeless narrative poem, "The Road Not Taken" Sounds very interesting, isn't it? How many people on earth would like to walk in the path among the few? Perhaps many would choose the easy way. What is the point of choosing the road not taken? It must be a difficult one and full of obstacles. Nevertheless, somewhere down the road, there must be someone out of billion of people who would prefer the journey on the rocky and winding road. Perhaps, its audacity leads him to discover himself in times of challenges along the way.

I pray in no time you will find the best road for you. As many would say, take time to enjoy the flowers along your journey. Let me end with this beautiful quote by Douglas Adams,“I may not have ended up where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up where I intended to be.”
