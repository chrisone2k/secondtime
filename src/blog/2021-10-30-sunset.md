description: Sunset is one of my favorite happenings here on earth because it reminds us to take a rest for a while. A simple clock that says, let us call it a day. A time where the sun is beyond the horizon.

Well, it is easy to look at it when its color turns orange. I love the feeling of witnessing this moment of seeing the sun painlessly. It is indeed majestic, while its rays are vanishing in the vastness of the sky.  When was the last time your attention was captured by the sun? On several occasions, my attention was caught by this event. Let me share two of my most remembered sunset stories. The first one, I was in my hometown. While riding a bike on the bridge, I suddenly saw from the distance the yellowish color of the sun about to hide behind the mountain. The second one was during the time I traveled near the shoreline with some of my family members and friends. Many of us take our own time to take a photo and seize the moment. Perhaps, others were simply amused with the color of the sun and the sky. And didn't bother to get any gadget to capture the beautiful canvas on the sky. 
My feeling during sunset is fantastic, but there were instances, I felt sad as well. Whatever the reason for my loneliness, I still look forward to seeing the sunset in the places I used to visit, even though sundown is not always happening at the same time.  I want to leave with the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Every sunset brings the promise of a new dawn."
