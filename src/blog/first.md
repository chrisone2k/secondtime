description: Water is one of the requirements for us to survive in this world. No one can last long without it. It is not only necessary for health reasons but also for personal hygiene. Just imagine a day without taking bath on a sunny and sweaty day.

The famous NBA basketball player, Dennis Rodman once said, "This life is like a swimming pool. You dive into the water, but you can't see how deep it is." 

I am standing on the famous landmark in one of the countries in the Middle East. This is not only a popular place, but also it is a source of life for many. It provides fresh water to the inhabitants in this area. Not to mention that it serves as a recreational place for both locals and foreigners. Moreover, there are some who do fishing, and others selling street foods. The pristine condition of this place provides nourishment not only to the body but also to the broken souls. Aside from its natural beauty, the hospitality and openness of the people is worth remembering. Needless to say this adventure signifies the beauty of our trip even a thousand miles away from my home country. My heart is filled with gratitude to our creator, for this majestic nature. My longing for serenity is totally satisfied.
