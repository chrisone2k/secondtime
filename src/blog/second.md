I am under the sun, in the middle of the rice fields. Good thing, the heat is bearable and the atmosphere in this place is out of this world. The greenery is like a carpet that sheeted on the floor, with refreshing theme. Behind me, you can see a pile of trees, thereby, creates a boundary that can be reached by your eyes. The blue skies, with clouds, depicts a beautiful canvass. Truly, this is a divine masterpiece, which doesn’t need artificial colors. Apart from the stunning view and picturesque mountains, the smell of the fresh air coming around the fields is mesmerizing. Subsequently, I love to see myself having a cup of coffee while seating inside that shelter not far from me. Imagine yourself, in complete tranquility as you gaze to your surroundings. Apart from nature, other things surely entertain you, like the hummingbirds that create natural music and the dancing of the rice plants to the tune of the breeze of wind. With no brainer, my childhood memories working in the field flashbacks, those episodes in my life are still vivid.
