The season that I love the most has already begun, it is a truly magical one. Not only the weather has been a bit colder for the past months, but the spirit of Yuletide is in the air. Now, I can hear my favorite song, “Christmas in Our Hearts,” its melody touches the deepest of my heart. 
Needless to say this year is quite different as compared to those seasons I had spent during my childhood and the previous ones. I pray and hope that no matter what happens the spirit of this celebration keeps on alive to everyone. Moreover, may these challenges open our hearts to love and give more, for we know that Christmas is a reminder of God’s love, by sending his only begotten son. My we become vessels of blessings to others and beacon of hope for those who need it. Remember that with our creator, we can find our solace, regardless of any happening in our life. 
Finally, I am excited and looking forward to another flight.
