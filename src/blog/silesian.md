description: I asked him the color of the leaves. “Yellow inst it?” He answered and consequently bend his knees and grabbed some on the ground. These leaves are brown, he added. Evidently, the change of colors signifies the process of events in the life of trees.

We keep on walking inside the huge park of Silesia and utter several adjectives that describe our admiration as we walk. 

I have visited this park several times and mentioned that he must see the park a couple of times. Until one time, he finally make up his mind to see it. He would say that it must be very beautiful prior to the autumn period. Apparantly,  he prefers to see the green leaves. As for me, I am amused seeing the abundance of color yellow with a touch of orange on leaves. I see it as very unusual and so vibrant. The diversity of colors brings a sense of uniqueness and dynamism. Well, each person has his own preference but one thing is for sure, each season has its own beauty. Let me borrow words from the resource person who gave a talk to us in 2004, “Bloom where you planted.”

On the other hand, tomorrow is my flight to Helsinki Finland. I feel excited, something new will be added to the list of my visited countries. Funny as it may sound. To date, I am in Tatamka Hostel in Warsaw. Indeed, this accommodation is highly recommended. Not to mention its good facilities, its location is close to many tourist attractions. I have got nice photos without getting tired of walking.

Let not the changes in our life make us weary but may it bring the best in us during the process. Let the leaves remind us, the beauty of every season under the sun.
