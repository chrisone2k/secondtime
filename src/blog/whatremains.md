description: What remains after the long walks? I asked myself this question.

I know our time means a portion of our life, not to mention the resources we have to put at stake on any trip. This one is worth your time. Simply look at the background of my photo. The Wawel Royal Castle for centuries served as the residence of the royal family. 

I easily get bored when the places I visited almost look the same. I tend to compare places.  I’ve told myself, this one looks like Paris or almost the same as London. Nevertheless, my intuition would direct me to move forward. Sure enough, I have many valuable things that are worth sharing. My friend, it is not merely about the infrastructure, the sceneries that count, but most importantly it is the people. Their goodness, kindness, and culture are what matter the most. I am fortunate enough that I have met many people during this trip that made an indelible mark on me.

The Harvard study about life, which has started in 1938 at the time of the Great Depression, is imparting us golden nuggets on how to live a healthy and happy life. I've learned that those people who value relationships are happier than those who value careers and other stuff. A famous cliché would say, “ No man is an Island.” In a simple word, there must be us and not only me.

My heartful gratitude to the friends that I met in Poland who made my journey like no other. The time you spent with me indeed reminds me of loving society. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart. You are what remains.
