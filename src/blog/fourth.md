There was a time I was standing on a shore and watching the big waves that come back and fort, and don't overflow as if they know their boundaries. It is a lovely experience to remember the touch of nature. By merely watching the tossing of the waves gives me an impression of its magical power. Indeed, it was created with higher wisdom. 
Others view this body of water as the cradle of life, primarily because it is a home for numerous marine life. Also, it provides a livelihood for many fishermen and food for the table of billions of people around the world.  Moreover, some see it as a medium of transportation of goods and services that connects one place to another. As for me, I look at it as a gift from God, a priceless one. Not so long ago, I had a photo that was taken from the shore of Subic Bay, this reminds me of the relaxing ambiance of that place, in addition to the cup of coffee from Starbucks. Meanwhile, what you can see on this still picture is one of the ports in Singapore. I love to remember this occasion, this picture was taken on April 14, 2014, at 6:58 pm.  Behind me was a huge sailing boat, it was beautiful.  I wish for another chance to travel by sea as I did on the other side of the world.
